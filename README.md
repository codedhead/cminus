cminus
======

This project started out as a validation for my two tools: lex,yacc, it's actually only a compiler front-end: it compiles source code to ASM code, and let MASM do the remaining job.

Cminus is a very simple language, no pointers, macros, structs... but it can still do something. I have included an example of quick sort written in this language, please see the 'demo' folder.

The code was written 3 years ago, I may get back to maintain it when I have time.
